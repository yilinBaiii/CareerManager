<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][application-screenshot]](https://developing.com)

This is a full-stack job application tool designed to help job seekers organize their job information. It utilizes the power of <strong>*MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js*</strong> to deliver a seamless experience. With this application, job seekers can easily manage and track their job search progress in one central location.

### Goals:
The goal of building a full-stack application from scratch is to gain hands-on experience with real-world projects and apply the skills learned in web development, while becoming familiar with large software applications. The following are the aspects that will be covered:

* Gain hands-on experience with a real-world project and apply what we have learned in web development to become familiar with larger software applications.

* Learn how to use **GitHub** and collaborate with other software engineers to promote **effective teamwork**.

* Learn to connect a front-end application (**React**) with a back-end application (**Express, MongoDB, NodeJS**) to establish a cohesive, functioning system.

* Implement **JWT** for authentication and authorization to enhance the security of your application.

* Learn how to incorporate **React Hooks**, **Async/Await**,** React Router 6**, and **Axio**s into the application to improve its functionality.

* Implement **ES6** in **Node** to enhance your server-side code.

* Gain experience in deploying your **MERN application** on **Heroku**, making it accessible to users worldwide.

* Develop an understanding of best practices for front-end and server applications to build a reliable and maintainable system.
